# CRA-Typescript-Redux-ReactRouter-MaterialUI-Prettier

## Technologies

[React](https://reactjs.org/) 17.0.1\
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 4.0.3\
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 4.0.5\
[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)5.2.0\
[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) 4.11.2\
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) 2.2.1

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14.4.0^\
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) 1.22.4^

## VSCode Extensions

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) - Autoformatting linter

## Setup

- Clone repository

```
git clone <REPO>
```

- In repository root, install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Run Application

Run in terminal the appropriate script at the root of the repository:

<br/>

- Run the app in the development mode

```
yarn start
```

> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in
> the console.

<br/>

- Build the app for production to the `build` folder

```
yarn build
```

> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
> best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

<br/>

- If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
  `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
  your project.

```
yarn eject
```

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!** >
> <br/> Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
> dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
> full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work,
> but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
> you’re on your own.\
> <br/> You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
> small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
> However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize
> it when you are ready for it.
